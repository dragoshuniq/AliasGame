• No translations or words with the same roots are allowed.

• If team members guess the root of the words, it can be used to explain in another way • Words are predicted only if the spelling matches exactly the word written on the card

• Words can be explained without maintaining the sequence.

• Even if the word is predicted by the opposing group, it can be accepted as the correct answer

If the word has not been broken or explain the prediction, it should be deselected.

If the user accidentally clicked on the unspoken word, it can be edited later on the score screen.`,
